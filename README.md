# Neighborhood Map Project
This web program lays out places I would I like to visit in my hometown.
Each place can be seen in the google map view as well as in the toolbar.

## Requirement
You need a web browser with a working internet connection.
I recommend Google Chrome:
https://www.google.com/chrome/b/

## Deployment
The site is published here:

To run the program open the "neighborhood_map.html" file in your web browser.

## Credit
I learned most of what I used in this application from Udacity and some lines
of code may be attributed to them.

## License
This project is public domain.
